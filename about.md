I'm an ethical hacker and Penetration Tester based in Miami, Florida. Previously, I've worked as a cybersecurity consultant specializing in security architecture, engineering, and vulnerability management/assessment. In that role, I've helped design and implement security frameworks tailored for government agencies and conducted in-depth vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in critical infrastructures. 

I now focus on offensive security primarily conducting web application, external, and internal assessments in addition to lots of fun social engineering/phishing for various industry organizations.
